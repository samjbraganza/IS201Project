                    My name is Sam Braganza, I was born in india and grew up in England. <br>
                    I moved to england when I was six years old. <br>
                    Growing up, I wanted to be in a rock band and tour the world. <br>
                    I was in a rock band for three years and played lead guitar at different venues to raise money for charities. <br>
                    I was first introduced to finance when I was a volunteer for my church in India. <br>
                    There I had a mentor who had a few successful businesses. I was inspired by the freedom and flexibility that his businesses gave him. <br>
                    He was helping others, had time for his family and had time to pursue his hobbies. <br>
                    He encouraged me to pursue finance when I returned home. <br>
                    I decided to study at BYU because of the great finance program at the marriott school of business. <br>
                    Here, I was introduced to the world of investment banking through the Investment Banking Association. <br>
                    This put me on a path to pursue investment banking today.</p>
